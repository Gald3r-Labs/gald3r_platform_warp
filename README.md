## What is Gald3r?

Gald3r is a framework that runs **inside your AI coding tool** -- not alongside it. Drop the
template into your project root and your AI assistant gains:

- **Persistent memory** across sessions (tasks, bugs, plans, constraints)
- **13 specialized agents**, **110 skills**, **179 commands** (`@g-status`, `@g-go`, `@g-medic`)
- **27 hooks** on IDE events, **14 rules** that keep agents disciplined

Everything is plain markdown in your repo. No server, no database, no Docker required.

## What's in this repo

This is the **Warp distribution** of Gald3r. The [`warp/`](./warp/) folder is a
complete, ready-to-deploy gald3r setup tuned for Warp -- drop its contents into your
project and your assistant gains persistent memory, agents, skills, commands, and hooks.

> **Using a different tool?** Gald3r supports 34 AI coding tools. Find yours at the main repo:
> **[github.com/wrm3/gald3r](https://github.com/wrm3/gald3r)**.

## Install

**New project** -> [instructions_new_project.md](./instructions_new_project.md)
**Existing project** -> [instructions_existing_project.md](./instructions_existing_project.md)

**TL;DR -- copy the payload into your project root:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wrm3/gald3r_platform_warp.git
cp -r gald3r_platform_warp/warp/. /path/to/your/project/
```

Then open the project in Warp and type `@g-status` to confirm gald3r loaded.

> The `warp/` payload is **additive** -- it drops in gald3r's config + `.gald3r/` state and
> does not touch your source. Your project keeps **its own** LICENSE and docs; the license in
> *this* repo covers the gald3r framework itself.

## The .gald3r/ Folder
